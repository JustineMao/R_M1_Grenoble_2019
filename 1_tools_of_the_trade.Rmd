# Tools used in the course

## Tools of the trade

- the course is (loosely) based on the *R for Data Science* book. Free reading and code [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
- R editor: [Rstudio (free)](www.rstudio.com)
- Packages: [tidyverse (free)](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
- Hosting and version control: [gitHub (free)](https://github.com/)
- Data: freely available data + eurostat + US data + web crawling (all free)

# R

## Your R background

> *How many of you have already used*

- Excel
- SAS, SPSS
- Stata
- Base R
- Tidyverse R
- Python, Jupyter, Julia, C, C++...

## Why R?

> *Why bother with R, of all tools?*

- it's free (as in *free beer* and also as in *free speech*)
- it has a *huge* code base and an *ever increasing* user base
- it is a programming language *built for doing statistics*
- it forces you to *understand what you are doing* (hard at first, but...)
- it forces you to use *scripts* -> reproducible research
- and if all of this does not convince you, *it is always better than Excel*

## Why not Excel? [a short rant]

> *Excel is really bad for serious work*

- It has a click-based interface that is a source of horrible errors
- Reinhardt & Rogoff [see here for more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_in_a_Time_of_Debt#Methodological_flaws)
- You can run macros, but then it gets awkward anyway

## Reproducible work: why

> *Whenever you do serius analysis, consider this*

- in any analysis, even the basics, you make *hundreds* of operations on your data
- each of them can be a mistake, can contain one, can be forgotten, or done twice
- if you get back to the data after 1 month, will you remember the choices made? 
- **NO**
- think how hard it can then be for *other people* to read your work
- **take care of your future self: do reproducible work**

## Reproducible work: how

- *You need to keep track of what you do. So:*

- always use a script-based language
- experiment interactively, try and re-try, but then lock what you did in a *script*
- comment extensively
- or, if too lazy, use a code that is *readable*
